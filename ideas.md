<idea>
  **Design Movement**: **Pacific Coastal Modernism**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Atmospheric Immersion**: The site should feel like being underwater or on the coast—calm, deep, and vast.
  2. **Clarity & Depth**: Information should be presented with crystal clarity, layered like ocean depths (surface level info -> deep dive details).
  3. **Organic Structure**: Layouts should flow naturally, avoiding rigid grids in favor of fluid, wave-like progressions.
  4. **Human Connection**: Emphasize the human element of conservation—Sean's journey and the community of protectors.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Ocean Blues & Teal**: Representing the marine environment (e.g., `#0F4C75`, `#3282B8`).
  - **Sand & Driftwood Neutrals**: Grounding the design in the terrestrial reality of coastal work (e.g., `#BBE1FA`, `#F0F4F8`).
  - **Coral Accents**: Used sparingly for calls to action, representing life and vitality (e.g., `#FF7E67`).
  - *Reasoning*: Evokes the serenity and seriousness of marine conservation while remaining inviting and professional.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Fluidity**: Content sections that drift and overlap slightly, mimicking the movement of tides.
  - **Sidebar Navigation**: A persistent left-hand navigation bar that acts as a "shoreline," anchoring the user while they explore the "ocean" of content on the right.
  - **Card-Based Discovery**: Opportunities presented as "specimens" or "findings" in a clean, card-based format that encourages exploration.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Wave Motifs**: Subtle SVG wave dividers between sections.
  - **Frosted Glass Effects**: Cards with backdrop-filter blur, resembling sea glass or looking through water.
  - **Topographic/Bathymetric Lines**: Subtle background patterns indicating depth and terrain.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Fluid Hover States**: Cards should lift and "float" when hovered.
  - **Smooth Scrolling**: Navigation should feel like gliding through water.
  - **Ripple Effects**: Buttons and interactive elements have subtle ripple animations on click.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Elements fade in and float up slowly, like bubbles rising.
  - **Parallax**: Background layers move at different speeds to create a sense of underwater depth.
  - **Loading**: A fluid liquid fill animation or a swimming marine creature.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Montserrat* (Bold, Uppercase) – Strong, geometric, and legible, reminiscent of maritime signage.
  - **Body**: *Lato* or *Open Sans* – Clean, humanist sans-serifs that are easy to read for long descriptions.
  - **Accents**: *Playfair Display* (Italic) – For quotes or inspirational text, adding a touch of elegance and history.

  **Design Movement**: **Scientific Field Journal**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Empirical Precision**: The design should feel like a well-kept field notebook—organized, detailed, and trustworthy.
  2. **Tactile Realism**: Use textures and visual metaphors that remind the user of physical fieldwork (paper, maps, sketches).
  3. **Data-Driven**: Highlight key metrics (salary, distance, requirements) prominently, like data points in a study.
  4. **Rugged Utility**: The aesthetic should feel durable and ready for the outdoors, not fragile or overly delicate.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Forest Green & Kelp**: Representing the intersection of land and sea flora (e.g., `#2C5F2D`, `#97BC62`).
  - **Slate Grey & Stone**: For text and structural elements, evoking rocky shores (e.g., `#4A4E69`).
  - **Safety Orange/Yellow**: High-visibility accents for important alerts or actions, mimicking field gear (e.g., `#FF9F1C`).
  - *Reasoning*: Communicates the practical, hands-on nature of the work Sean is seeking.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Grid-Based Notebook**: A structured, multi-column layout that resembles a field guide or ledger.
  - **Top Navigation with Breadcrumbs**: Clear hierarchy tracking, essential for navigating complex taxonomies of jobs.
  - **Split-Screen Detail View**: List on the left, details on the right—efficient for comparing specimens (jobs).

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Monospace Data Tags**: Use a monospace font for salaries, dates, and IDs to emphasize data.
  - **Sketch-Style Icons**: Hand-drawn style icons for job categories (e.g., a sketch of a dolphin for marine biology).
  - **Paper Texture Backgrounds**: Subtle grain or paper texture on the main content area.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap & Click**: Interactions should feel mechanical and precise, like clicking a pen or snapping a carabiner.
  - **Highlighting**: Hover states look like a highlighter marker stroke.
  - **Tabbed Organization**: Use tabs to organize job details (Overview, Requirements, Benefits) like a file folder.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide & Reveal**: Panels slide in from the side or unfold like a map.
  - **Typewriter Effect**: Key data points appear character by character.
  - **Instant Transitions**: Minimal easing, favoring quick, snappy state changes.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Roboto Slab* or *Bitter* – Strong serifs that feel authoritative and grounded.
  - **Body**: *Inter* or *Source Sans Pro* – Highly legible, neutral sans-serif for density.
  - **Data/Labels**: *JetBrains Mono* or *Fira Code* – For technical details, reinforcing the scientific aesthetic.

  **Design Movement**: **Eco-Brutalist / Digital Nature**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Honesty**: Expose the structure of the content without excessive decoration.
  2. **High Contrast**: Bold, readable text against stark backgrounds to ensure accessibility in bright outdoor conditions.
  3. **Digital Native Ecology**: Blending the raw aesthetic of early web brutalism with organic, high-resolution imagery.
  4. **Action-Oriented**: Large touch targets and clear directives—designed for getting the job done.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Charcoal & Black**: High contrast backgrounds (e.g., `#1A1A1A`).
  - **Neon Algae Green**: Electric accents that pop against the dark mode, symbolizing bioluminescence (e.g., `#39FF14`).
  - **Electric Blue**: For links and interactive elements (e.g., `#00FFFF`).
  - *Reasoning*: A modern, edgy take on conservation that appeals to a younger, tech-savvy generation while maximizing readability.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Bento Box Grid**: Modular, block-based layout where every element lives in a clearly defined rectangular cell.
  - **Oversized Typography**: Headlines that span the full width, acting as graphical elements themselves.
  - **Sticky Headers/Footers**: Controls are always accessible, pinned to the edges of the viewport.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Thick Borders**: Heavy outlines around all interactive elements.
  - **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text for urgent updates or featured jobs.
  - **Glitch/Distortion Effects**: Subtle digital noise on hover to represent the "digital" lens on nature.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover Inversion**: Elements invert colors completely on hover (black on green -> green on black).
  - **Cursor Effects**: A custom cursor that reacts to elements (e.g., expanding circle).
  - **Kinetic Scrolling**: Fast, momentum-based scrolling.

  **Animation**:
  - **Hard Cuts**: No fades; elements appear instantly or slide in with aggressive easing.
  - **Staggered Reveal**: Grid items load one by one in a rapid sequence.
  - **Continuous Motion**: Background elements (like a slow-moving starfield or plankton) are always in subtle motion.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Space Grotesk* or *Syne* – Wide, quirky sans-serifs with character.
  - **Body**: *Archivo* – A grotesque sans-serif designed for digital screens.
  - **Display**: *Druk Wide* (or similar free alternative like *Chivo*) – For massive, impactful section headers.
